Overview
========
* PHP & MySQL (standard LAMP stack)
* Drupal Pros (Modularity, Flexibility, Stability, Community)
* Drupal Cons (Bare bones, Steep learning curve, modules not always plug and play, Hard for lay users, lack of decent themes)
* What it's good for: Large custom sites, Enterprise level sites, Gov sites, multiple content heavy sites
* Some examples: [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk), [The Economist](https://drupal.org/node/915102), [The Whitehouse](http://www.whitehouse.gov/), [Smithsonian Institution Transcriptions](http://transcription.si.edu/), [Harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu/), [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/), [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/), and [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/).

Whats Now

* Drupal 7
* 26,110 contributed modules
* Over 1,047,545 Community users on D.O

Distributions
----------
Generally speaking, Distributions are "pre-packaged" templates/modules/configurations aimed at providing either a complete site out of the box, or a base for specific use cases.

Also can create your own distro/configure your own custom Installation Profile.
